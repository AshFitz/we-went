## Design Choices:
<p> The design of the site needs to draw the user in to ensure they stay and view what what the site offers. The colours need to be appealing and compliment the the content and the images as wel as the users content and images. The site will have a minimalistic theme to prevent the user from being distracted by the colours. The design will ensure the site is easily navigated which will result in users returning and signing up. 
</p>

### Fonts:
* [Signika](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Signika?query=Signika)
<p>I chose this font family for the webste as it compliments the color scheme, theme and the content well. It is easily readable and adds to the clean and elegant style.
</p>

### Icons:
<p> I have used multiple icons from font-awsome. They offer a wide range of icons and will help the usser to identify the buttons use. For example, icons were used for edit and deleting comments.
</p>

### Colours:
<p> I chose the colours below because they suit the theme of the site, adventure and activity. They provides a earthy feel to the site while keeping the it minimalistic. They compliment themselves, the content and the images well. They will help to compliment the users posts also. The content is clearly readable and the site navigates well due to the colours. It increases the appeal of the wesbsite and UX. The colours used across the site are listed below.
</p>

* Primary Colour - #E6E5DE - This is an off white colour with a grey understone. This colour was used for the nav bar, footer, home background, acitivty background and the logo.
* Secondary Colour - #041F1E - This is an emerald green colour. This was used for most of the text, icons, logo and the profile background colour.
* Tertiary Colour - C57B57 - This is a pale orange colour. Which was used for the like, edit and delte post icons, on hover icons, some of the home page text and the post buttons.

### Images
<p> The images I used on the home page compliment the content and the colour. The images were in contrast with the theme of adventures and activities. They help the user to understand the goal and use of the site. The images were sourced from  <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">Unsplash</a> and <a href="https://pexels.com/" target="_blank">Pexels</a>, which are high quality and completely free stock photos.
</p>

## Wireframes:
<p> The wireframes were created in <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">balsamiq</a>. This helped me to plan the visual look of the website. I created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop.
